        <h1>How to Survive a Bear Attack with Style</h1>
        
        <p>So, you're walking through the woods alone cause you have no friends and you're obviously lost. You're trying to remember all the lessons you learned from Bear Grylls when all of a sudden you see an adorable pack of bear cubs. You immediately realize how bad the situation is when you hear mama bear barrelling down the hill heading straight towards you. Your first though is probably something along the lines of "well, I had a good run." Fear not, for this guide will teach you everything you need to know to <del>die</del> survive with style.</p>
        
        <h2>What you will need:</h2>
        <p>Be sure to pack all of these things <i>before</i> you go out into the great outdoors in case of emergency.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Courage.</li>
            <li>Some more courage.</li>
            <li>A hunting knife.</li>
            <li>Pepper spray.</li>
            <li>Food and bottled water.</li>
            <li>Rope.</li>
            <li>An extra pair of pants.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Step 1: Consider reasoning with the bear.</h2>
        <p>Explain to mama bear that you're only looking for the parking lot and meant no harm to her little offspring. Try to appear as unappetizing as possible. Hopefully the bear will understand your situation and maybe even give you directions. It's always a good idea to start with a friendly approach. However, if the bear continues to be rude, move on to the next step.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 2: Identify your bear.</h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, not all bears are small stuffed furballs named Teddy. Something you should do before going out to the wilderness is take some time to learn what different kinds of bears look like. It'll help you quickly determine your best approach for survival or simply give you a name to curse while you're being eaten alive. Let's go through some of the common features for each species:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_black_bear">American black bear:</a></h3><br>
            <img src="black_bear.jpg" width="256" alt="Picture of a black bear."> <br>
                Oddly enough, not all black bears have black fur. Their color ranges from black to blond. Furthermore, if you think you're being attacked by a black bear, try to wipe your tears away long enough to take a look at its chest. You might see what looks like a white bib. It's actually a patch of white fur unique to black bears. The bear was most likely <b>not</b> planning on eating you ahead of time.
            </li>
            <li><h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_bear">Brown bear:</a></h3><br>
            <img src="brown_bear.jpg" width="256" alt="Picture of a brown bear."> <br>
                Much like black bears, brown bears aren't always brown. Their coloring can be anywhere from black to blond, however brown bear fur appears to be silver-tipped, hence the name "grizzly." They also have a prominent hump over their shoulders. Brown bears are also known for being able to stand up on both hind legs and stand up to 12 feet tall to look extra scary to their <dfn title="You!">prey</dfn>.
            </li>
            <li><h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear">Polar bear:</a></h3><br>
            <img src="polar_bear.jpg" width="256" alt="Picture of a polar bear."> <br>
                Polar bears are probably the easiests bears to identify. If their white fur wasn't already a dead giveaway, their enormous size will probably get the message across. Seriously, these animals are the largest terrestrial carnivores in the world. Fortunately these monsters only live in the Arctic Circle so if you spot one, you're probably more lost than you think.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Step 3: Act like you know what you're doing.</h2>
        <p>If the bear attacks, your first instinct will be to panic. This is generally considered a very bad move. Don't panic. There's a few things you can do that might help show the bear who's the more evolved mammal.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Try to appear larger to the bear. Spread your legs a bit and raise your arms over your head, holding your jacket if you have one. Hopefully, you're tall.</li>
            <li>Don't make eye contact. Bears are very self-conscious.</li>
            <li>If it's nighttime and you have a flashlight, shine it on the bear and ask it if it has been drinking this evening.</li>
            <li>Stand your ground. Don't run away like a little girl. Remember your place in the food chain. Also, bears can run wicked fast.</li>
            <li>If you spot a tree, don't climb it.</li>
            <li>Keep your distance. Try to have large objects between yourself and the bear, such as trees, rocks or other people.</li>
            <li>If you're dealing with a brown bear, playing dead is a good option. Just lie flat on your stomach and cover the back of your neck.</li>
            <li>If you're dealing with a black bear or a polar bear, don't even consider playing dead unless you actually want to <i>be</i> dead.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Step 4: Engage the bear in combat.</h2>
        <p>Bears often do bluff charges to mess with you. Stand your ground unless you're sure it's not a bluff. If it is, speak softly and back away slowly. If it's not, it's time to get physical. Remember the following techniques.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always have the high ground. Bears are fat so it's harder for them to attack if you have gravity as your ally.</li>
            <li>Use your legs not your arms. Punches are a big no-no but straight kicks are a good strategy. Think cops breaching doors in a drug bust.</li>
            <li>Protect yourself above all else. Bears hit hard. If you get swiped you're pretty much done.</li>
            <li>If you have a weapon like a knife or pepper spray, use it. If you don't, throw anything you have at it. Books, cameras, shoes, your firstborn, anything.</li>
            <li>Once you've hurt the bear, it'll see you as a threat. No going back on that one so if it doesn't run away, keep fighting.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Step 5: Call it a day and go home.</h2>
        <p>With what you've learned you're very likely to survive a bear attack <del>mostly</del> intact. Once the dust settles and the bear is gone, pick up any pieces you may have lost and start making your way home... or a hospital.
