<h1>Rikki-Tikki-Tavi <br>
by Rudyard Kipling</h1>

<hr>

<p style="text-align: center"><i><b>At the hole where he went in <br>
Red-Eye called to Wrinkle-Skin. <br>
Hear what little Red-Eye saith: <br>
"Nag, come up and dance with death!" <br>
Eye to eye and head to head, <br>
(Keep the measure, Nag.) <br>
This shall end when one is dead; <br>
(At thy pleasure, Nag.) <br>
Turn for turn and twist for twist-- <br>
(Run and hide thee, Nag.) <br>
Hah! The hooded Death has missed! <br>
(Woe betide thee, Nag!) <br>
